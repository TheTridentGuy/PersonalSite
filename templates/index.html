    <p>
      I'm a <span data-date="2008-06-03"></span>-year-old full stack developer,
      linux enthusiast, sysadmin, and <a href="/fursona">furry</a> based in San
      Francisco, California, USA. I am also a member of the wonderful community
      known as <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, an amazing home for
      teen nerds like me. As far as programming I'm mostly self-taught, through
      reading and Stack Overflow. My current favorite stack is a Flask backend,
      with a vanilla HTML, CSS and JS frontend. I currently attend Lowell High
      School, and am a member of their robotics team
      <a href="https://team4159.org">4159 CardinalBotics</a>. I got my amateur
      radio license in summer 2024, and enjoy operating whenever I'm out about.
      I've always loved to read, and even though I don't have much time anymore,
      it's still one of my passions. My favorite series is the OG Percy Jackson
      books, by Rick Riordan, which incidentally is also the source of the
      username many of you know me by. In second place is the Spy School by
      Stuart Gibbs, tied with the Alex Rider series by Anthony Horowitz. My
      preffered music genre is elctronic, especially EDM, and I'm a huge fan of
      Alan Walker, K-391, cyberhound and ivycomb. When I need a break from
      coding, I play a lot of
      <a href="/gaming">Call of Duty: Mobile, and Valorant</a>. Feel free to DM
      me on the HC slack, or discord :3

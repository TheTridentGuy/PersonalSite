# PersonalSite
> ## Other ships I'm proud of:
> - Bot that my robotics team uses to keep track of hours: https://github.com/TheTridentGuy/SlackSignInBot
> - A fun little userscript that I made for Slack: https://github.com/TheTridentGuy/SlackCuddles
> - A fun site I made for a friend, and scored surprisingly well in High Seas: https://github.com/TheTridentGuy/DecryptThis
> ## What I want to build at scrapyard:
> - Relationships with my fellow hackers.
> - Open-source contribution goal tracker: I want to start contributing to more projects, so I'd like to build a display that I can keep on my wall that can track my goals, i.e. 1 commit per day, and 1 PR per week.
> - Extension of my trail and boreal projects.
